Hello, Jesus my friend
You have helped me to the end
Sometimes I branch out on my own
End up whichever way the wind has blown
Places traveled just arenâ€™t right
Finding my way back takes all my might
Overwhelming both body and soul 
I fight to repent, it takes its toll
My mind is spinning, what can I do
Look to the Savior, He died for you
Be humble and prayerful is what I was taught
Answers and comfort will enter your thoughts
Back on the straight path together you go
No longer affected by which way the wind blows
Remember the Lord in all you do
Make sure in the end he knows about you
