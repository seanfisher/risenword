Bunnies and eggs aren’t the holidays
When it comes to eggs
The true story of Easter is light and dark
It’s about Jesus not eggs, 
He died for our sins
It’s sad but it’s true
And that’s all I can do.
He died
On a cross
With his
Hands nailed
In it was 
Hard for him
It was hard for us now that’s
All I can say except
For this: He was very
Very brave.
