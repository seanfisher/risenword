In the quiet ache of morning, 'neath the pale dawn's tender glow, 
A grieving Daughter lingered—near the tomb, with heart laid low.
Bleak sorrow won the moment, wet emotion traced her face; 
For the One who once had healed her was no longer there encased.
At the precipice of meaning, seeming hope had dash-ed been; 
a piece of path we all too face when present seems too grim.
And in that hollow silence, one tear fell, and twirled, and glistened; 
Creation paused that instant 'fore her grief would be rechristened.

Then—
Just one word—a whispered mercy—but she knew who spoke the same; 
Her breath caught in amazement as the Gard'ner called her name.
"Mary," spoke he gently, tender power filled His tone; 
In that instant grief departed—she stood not alone, but known.

Now—
Her future, sacred past for us, shone brighter through His light; 
our future, woven with His life, gleams endless in his sight.
So, daughters, when life's darkness leaves your heart and hopes grown dim, 
Remember Mary at the tomb; remember Risen Him.
His voice can pierce all sorrow, His love knows no divide; 
Hear Him calling, softly calling, Stand in hope—He is alive.
