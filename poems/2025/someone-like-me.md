They say love is patient, love is kind—
But we forget that love also bleeds.
That love got spit on, whipped, mocked with a crown it didn’t deserve dragged a cross it didn’t earn.

See—
Christ didn’t come with lightning and war cries
He came with skin
With dust on his feet and truth in his eyes.

And we?
We were busy counting sins 
Drowning lines in the dirt 
Acting like grace was something we could gate-keep.

But he knelt 
Wrote mercy in the sand
Said, “let the one without sin cast the first stone and silence fell harder than judgement ever could.”

This 
This is forgiveness that doesn’t flinch
This is love that doesn’t wait
This is a savior that sees you raw and real 
And still calls you “mine.”

We keep asking,
How could God love someone like me?
But the cross already answered that.
Love showed up. 
Not in comfort, but in chaos
Not in riches, but in ruin
Not to condemn but to carry
Every burden
Every shame
Every name we gave ourselves that he never did.

But he says “you are forgiven” 

Now go live like you are.
