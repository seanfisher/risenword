I sat in silence, still and small,
Eyes fixed upon the shadowed wall.
A shape unknown, a hollow mark—
It danced and deepened in the dark.

Its edges whispered doubt and fear,
Each breath I took, it drew more near.
I thought the dark was all there was—
A silent weight, a quiet cause.

But somewhere just behind my seat,
A warmth began to stir and beat.
I turned, though slow and filled with dread,
And felt the light fall on my head.

Not harsh, but kind, it touched my face—
A tender flood of truth and grace.
No shout, no thunder in the skies,
Just mercy glowing in His eyes.

The wall remained, the shadow stayed,
But no more power had it made.
For now I knew the Source of day,
The One who never turns away.

So when the dark begins to call,
I do not fear the shadowed wall.
I simply turn—and find release,
My face aglow, my heart at peace.
