In the morning
I reached for you across the cold cold bed
And felt the emptiness instead...

At lunch
The soup was on. I called your name.
Then waited, but you never came.

At night
I knelt beside the bed – alone...
And realized – again – that you were really gone.

The days pass slowly. The nights are long.
I yearn to hear your familiar song.....

But, you aren't here....
And...old age for me is drawing near

Soon I too will draw my own last breath of air.
BUT - I’m not afraid - because....

Because of HIM, 
I know that you'll be waiting there.
