New light again, longer days. Ah, the green, green: budding, burgeoning, bursting even.
White rabbits lay chicken eggs and jelly beans while brown ones melt in the sudden sweaty heat.
Swirling pastels greet grinning children, with showers and flowers perplexing casters.
What vibrancy is brought to the world, what life! 

And this is only the temporary one.

(What life is brought to the world, indeed!)
