Tulips rise up through a cocoa-crust barrier
In colors of rainbow, the more the merrier. 

Bubbly yeast has a feast, making magic in dough
Fermenting and rising the bread oh so slow.

Smoke curls and dances as it fades through a rise
Sending vapor and ash into sapphire skies

Just as faithful as ever, the sun and her rays
Rise up each morning, nudging dark into day 

Come April and May, when Spring flings on the scene
Temperatures rise and turn flora to green

But the best rise of all, conquering life after death
Comes from our Savior and his miraculous gift

Suffering then rising, to save each of us
It is in His Atonement, I am placing my trust. 

Wonâ€™t it be grand, such a marvelous sight 
When we conquer death and rise into the light
