title: About The Risen Word
---

The Risen Word is a compilation of Christian poetry celebrating the life, mission, divinity, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Our mission is to inspire and showcase poetry that reflects the hope, joy, and transformative power of Christ. We especially love Easter.

<div class="my-4">
  This past Easter, we invited poets to submit their work in two categories:
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mt-2">
    <li>Short form poetry (including haiku, tanka, and other brief forms)</li>
    <li>Long form poetry (including sonnets, free verse, and narrative poems)</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="mt-4">
  Winners were selected based on their artistic merit, spiritual depth, and ability to communicate the Easter message in fresh and compelling ways.

  We believe that poetry has a unique ability to touch hearts and minds, helping us experience the profound truth of Christ's resurrection.
