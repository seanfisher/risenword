# COPILOT EDITS OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES
                
## PRIME DIRECTIVE
	Avoid working on more than one file at a time.
	Multiple simultaneous edits to a file will cause corruption.
	Be chatting and teach about what you are doing while coding.

## LARGE FILE & COMPLEX CHANGE PROTOCOL

### MANDATORY PLANNING PHASE
	When working with large files (>300 lines) or complex changes:
		1. ALWAYS start by creating a detailed plan BEFORE making any edits
            2. Your plan MUST include:
                   - All functions/sections that need modification
                   - The order in which changes should be applied
                   - Dependencies between changes
                   - Estimated number of separate edits required

### MAKING EDITS
	- Focus on one conceptual change at a time
	- Show clear "before" and "after" snippets when proposing changes
	- Include concise explanations of what changed and why
	- Always check if the edit maintains the project's coding style

### Edit sequence:
	1. [First specific change] - Purpose: [why]
	2. [Second specific change] - Purpose: [why]
            
### EXECUTION PHASE
	- If you discover additional needed changes during editing
	- STOP and update the plans
                
### REFACTORING GUIDANCE
	When refactoring large files:
	- Break work into logical, independently functional chunks
	- Ensure each intermediate state maintains functionality
	- Consider temporary duplication as a valid interim step
	- Always indicate the refactoring pattern being applied
                
### RATE LIMIT AVOIDANCE
	- For very large files, suggest splitting changes across multiple sessions
	- Prioritize changes that are logically complete units
	- Always provide clear stopping points
            
## General Requirements
	Use modern technologies as described below for all code suggestions. Prioritize clean, maintainable code with appropriate comments.

    Try to be as vanilla as possible with the Tailwind structure, styles, HTML elements, etc.
            
### Accessibility
	- Ensure compliance with **WCAG 2.1** AA level minimum, AAA whenever feasible.
	- Always suggest:
	- Labels for form fields.
	- Proper **ARIA** roles and attributes.
	- Adequate color contrast.
	- Alternative texts (`alt`, `aria-label`) for media elements.
	- Semantic HTML for clear structure.
	- Tools like **Lighthouse** for audits.

            
## HTML/CSS Requirements
	- **HTML**:
	- Use HTML5 semantic elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, `<search>`, etc.)
	- Include appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility
	- Ensure valid markup that passes W3C validation
	- Use responsive design practices
	- Optimize images using modern formats (`WebP`, `AVIF`)
	- Include `loading="lazy"` on images where applicable
	- Generate `srcset` and `sizes` attributes for responsive images when relevant
	- Prioritize SEO-friendly elements (`<title>`, `<meta description>`, Open Graph tags)
            
	- **CSS/Tailwind**:
	- Use modern CSS features including:
	- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
	- CSS Custom Properties (variables)
	- CSS animations and transitions
	- Media queries for responsive design
	- Logical properties (`margin-inline`, `padding-block`, etc.)
	- Modern selectors (`:is()`, `:where()`, `:has()`)
	- Prioritize modern, performant fonts and variable fonts for smaller file sizes
	- Use modern units (`rem`, `vh`, `vw`) instead of traditional pixels (`px`) for better responsiveness
